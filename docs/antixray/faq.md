# FAQ

### Q: What is the difference between RaytraceAntiXray and Paper's Anti-Xray?
Paper's Ant-Xray only hide ores that are surrounded by blocks, because of that **all exposed ores are still visible to xray**.
RaytraceAntiXray uses raytracing to determine if the ores are visible to the player, and show/hide them runtime.
And with all the addons, essentially get rid of every advantage of ESP.

### Q: How much memory does RaytraceAntiXray use?

Overall, RaytraceAntiXray uses around 5-10MB of memory per player with a render distance of 16 and spread across the world.
We would suggest to add 10-20% more memory to your server to accommodate RaytraceAntiXray if your memory usage was already high.

### Q: Why are ores visible when I open x-ray?
Those are **Fake Ore** feature of RaytraceAntiXray.
