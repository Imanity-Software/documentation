# FAQ

## What is the difference between RaytraceAntiXray and Paper's Anti-Xray?
Paper's Ant-Xray only hide ores that are surrounded by blocks, because of that **all exposed ores are still visible to xray**.
RaytraceAntiXray uses raytracing to determine if the ores are visible to the player, and show/hide them runtime.
And with all the addons, essentially get rid of every advantage of ESP.

## Why are ores visible when I open x-ray?
Those are **Fake Ore** feature of RaytraceAntiXray.
You can go ahead and try to mine them, but you will not see them disappearing before your eyes.
