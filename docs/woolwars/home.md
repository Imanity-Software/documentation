## What is WoolWars? {#what-is-woolwars}

A competitive arena game that players split into 2 team teams. Players have to fight for the center control point.
Whoever filled center area with their wools, wins the round. Once the round has started, the two teams will be released
into the arena to battle each other, collect power-ups from around the map, and
replace the control point with their team's coloured wool. Rounds are played at a fast pace and players will only
respawn in the next round if they are killed. The first team to win all three rounds will be the winner of the game!
