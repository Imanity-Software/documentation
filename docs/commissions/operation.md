# Operation

The process of how we operate our commissions is pretty simple, and we will explain it in this page.

## Order
- You can order a commission by opening a ticket in our [support server](https://go.imanity.dev/discord) under the **Commission** category.
- Follow the process and answer the questions with the information we need to know to speed up the process!
- Upon all the question is completed, staff member will review your order and will contact you if there is any questions or if we need more information.
- You can decide if you allow us to use your order as a reference for our portfolio, or you can choose to keep it private.
- If everything is good and features are clear, we will estimate the time and price for your order!
- Once the order is accepted, we will require a **50% deposit** before we start working on your order. or you can choose to pay the full price before we start working on your order.
- Payment are handled by [Tebex Checkout](https://shop.imanity.dev/category/custom), you can pay with PayPal, Credit Card, and more!
- Once payment is received, we will start working on your order!
- You will be updated with the progress of your order every 24 ~ 48 hours unless specified.
- If you decided to cancel your order, the deposit will not be refunded.
- Once the order is completed, we will send you a preview image, video, or a test server address for you to test the order. 
- If you are satisfied with the order, we will require the remaining payment before we deliver the order.
- Upon the order is delivered, the ticket will be closed, or stay open if you ordered after-sales support.
