# ImanitySpigot FAQ

## Will there be a test server?

Currently, we do not provide any test servers, but we are working hard on this and may launch it in the future.
At this moment, you're able to check `#ðŸ’»â”ƒservers` in our discord channel to view a list of the servers that currently
using ImanitySpigot3.

## How to update my ImanitySpigot?

You can update your spigot build by typing `!update` in the server console, selecting a version and restart your server.

It will automatically update the jar after restart. You can view your version information by typing `!version` in your console.

Also, take a look of the `Automated Update system` settings in `imanity/rancha.yml`.

## Is there an API Documentation for Developers?

[**Yes, of course, we do!**](/imanityspigot/api/api-overview "Developer API")

## How to make my server support 1.7/1.9+?

Since ImanitySpigot 3 started to develop and we decided to remove built-in multiple version support features. You
can use these method below to make your server support 1.7/1.9+:

:::info **Want 1.9+ support?**

Install **[ViaVersion](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/viaversion.19254/ "ViaVersion - allowing 1.9.x players and above to connect")**

:::

:::info **Want 1.7+ support?**

or **[ProtocolSupport](https://protocol.support/old/)**.

## Additions

### How does addition work on ImanitySpigot?

When you purchase the Addition, you will not need to install it. It will be linked to your license, and will be
available to use when you launch the Spigot.
If you have an addition, you can change the desired options with the configuration file created.
