## How to make my server support 1.7/1.9+?

Since ImanitySpigot 3 started to develop and we decided to remove built-in multiple version support features. You
can use these method below to make your server support 1.7/1.9+:

:::info **Want 1.9+ support?**

Install **[ViaVersion](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/viaversion.19254/ "ViaVersion - allowing 1.9.x players and above to connect")**

:::

:::info **Want 1.7+ support?**

Install **[ViaRewind](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/viarewind.52109/ "ViaRewind - allowing 1.7.x and 1.8.x players to connect")**
or **[ProtocolSupport](https://protocol.support/old/)**.
