<summary>Report a bug :bug:</summary>
<br>

This section guides you through reporting a bug. Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community
understand the bug, reproduce the behavior, and find related bugs.

### Before reporting a bug

Please check the following list:

- **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [**
  Issues**](https://github.com/Imanity-Software/documentation/issues). If the bug has already been reported **and the issue is
  still open**, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.

**Note:** If you find a **Closed** issue that seems similar to what you're experiencing, open a new issue and include a
link to the original issue in the body of your new one.

### Submitting A Bug Report

To report a bug, [open a new issue](https://github.com/Imanity-Software/documentation/issues/new), and be sure to include as many
details as possible, using the template.

**Note:** Minor changes such as fixing a typo can but do not need an open issue.

If you also want to fix the bug, submit a [pull request](#pull-requests) and reference the issue.

This section guides you through suggesting a new feature or adding a new topic to the docs. Following these guidelines
helps maintainers and the community collaborate to find the best possible way forward with your suggestion.

### Before suggesting a new feature

**Ensure the feature or topic has not already been suggested** by searching on GitHub under [**
Issues**](https://github.com/Imanity-Software/documentation/issues).

### Suggesting a new feature or topic

To suggest a new feature/topic, [open a new issue](https://github.com/Imanity-Software/documentation/issues/new), using the
suggestion template.

<details>
<summary>Add a new feature or topic to the docs :hammer:</summary>
<br>

This section guides you through adding a new feature or topic. Following these guidelines helps give your feature/topic
the best chance of being approved and merged.

### Before adding a new feature/topic

Check if there is already an [open issue](https://github.com/Imanity-Software/documentation/issues/)
or [pull request (PR)](https://github.com/Imanity-Software/documentation/pulls), related to your feature/topic.

Otherwise, your feature may not be approved at all.

### Adding a new feature/topic

To build a new feature/topic, check out a new branch based on the `main` branch.

<details>
<summary>Pull requests :mega:</summary>
<br>

This section guides you through submitting a pull request (PR). Following these guidelines helps give your PR the best
chance of being approved and merged.

### Before submitting a pull request

Before submitting a pull request, please follow these steps to have your contribution considered by the maintainers:

- A pull request should have exactly one concern (for example one feature or one bug). If a PR addresses more than one
  concern, it should be split into two or more PRs.

- A pull request can be merged only if it references an open issue

  **Note:** You don't need to open an issue for minor changes such as typos, but you can if you want.

- All code should be well tested

### Submitting a pull request

The following is a typical workflow for submitting a new pull request:

1. Fork this repository
2. Create a new branch based on your fork. For example, `git checkout -b fix/my-fix`
   or ` git checkout -b feat/my-feature`.
3. Commit changes and push them to your fork
4. Target your pull request to be merged with `develop`

If the maintainer approves the PR, it will be merged.

**Note:** Reviewers may ask you to complete additional work, tests, or other changes before your pull request can be
approved and merged.
